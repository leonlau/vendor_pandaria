Rancher API Types
========

API Types for Rancher 2.0

## Building

`make`

## Running the code generator

Run `go generate` in the root of the project

### Running code generation after go modules

The code generation code still depends on the GOPATH. 
To generate types you need to update vendor.

1. Update go.mod for what you need 
2. Run `GO111MODULE=on go mod vendor`
3. Export your gopath (export GOPATH=types_go_path_dir)
4. Run `GO111MODULE=off go generate`
5. Unset your `GOPATH`
